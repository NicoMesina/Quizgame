**Purpose**

Hi everyone, I hope you are having a wonderful day today. For this project I have created a nice simple fun quiz for any type of user and the main purpose and goal here is to provide a challenging quiz to entertain online users. There are 10 different questions and the questions are based on random things just as I thought its more fun than just keeping it as the same subject. The purpose of this quiz is to bring fun, joy, and overall, a good quiz experience. As you will notice this quiz has a bright blue colour that really stands out and a background of quiz stars to catch users attention as much as possible. In most cases quiz games are meant to bring excitement and some type of competition to see who got more answers correct or less and therefore I also have introduced a scoreboard which I thought it will bring more excitement to the game. The main purpose of this game is as followed, 

Fun and joyful competition 
Eye catching experience 
Scoreboard to make it more interesting 
Menu navigation bar that allows the user to leave a feed back for a better improvement and also a signup form where the user can always come back as a user and play new quiz games that will be available in near future. 


**Challenges faced:** 

This has been a project full of emotions considering that I am a complete beginner at this. I have spent hours and hours and I am very thankful for the experience. JavaScript was defiantly much tougher than expected but to see the final result was a great joy for me. My biggest challenge was the quiz container itself, the scoreboard, and even the navigation bar. It all took time, to make sure its all functioning the correct way for the user. 

**Quiz container:** 

The quiz container itself has a light blue margin to give catchy attention for the user while playing the quiz. The main fond is “Font-family times new roman”. Nice bold writing so it stands out for the user while reading the question. 

**Background:** 

The background of this quiz is full of positive energy in my opinion as it gives catchy attention thanks to the stars and blue colours mixed with some type of orange. It’s an image already containing the quiz stars. 

**Scoreboard:** 

The scoreboard was one of the most important parts as it keeps the user entertained and focused on the game itself. I wanted this score board to be simple and straight to the point giving the user the score so they can see how many questions they have answered correctly. 

**Menu navigation bar:** 

The menu navigation bar was an important aspect for this project as I thought it’s very important for the user to leave a feedback information so that way I can continue improving. Also, we have a signup page that allows the user to become a user and easily access the page as a user and play new quizzes available in the near future. You might notice that the feedback form and the signup form is not placed in the centre of the page, and to be honest I found it stylish in a way to have it the way it is. I thought both forms are looking eye catchy on the top left side of the page with correct set of margins and padding that makes it look not too big or too small. 

**Submit button:** 

The submit button has the colour of rgb 23, 245, 245, it’s a light blue colour that almost gives the impression of a click me now to see the answer in a positive way. I did not want the user to feel negative during the game and that was the reason for this colour. In many cases users quit as soon as they see red flags everywhere and, in this case, I did not use any red negative flags for this reason. Let’s keep the user happy and entertained in a chilled positive matter. Thjis was my goal for this submit button. 

 **User Goal**

**First Time Visitor Goals**

- As a First Time user, I want them to feel free and happy playing the quiz game.

- As a First Time user, I want them to see their score and keep motivated throughout the game. 
- As a First Time user, I want them to easily to become a user and feel free to join the new quizzes that will be available in the near future. 


**Frequent Visitor Goals**

- As a Frequent user, I would like them to be able to see the new updates and new games available. 

**Structure**

The main structure is based on html and css coding here. Css was the trick to style and have this quiz as eye catchy as possible in order to keep the user entertained and motivated throughout the game. JS came along to make sure it makes the quiz alive, clickable and most importantly having that score board working the correct way. 

**Design**

- Colour  

At first, I wanted to use a normal colour as background but then I came up with this idea of having a background of a quiz image that basically represents everything in one. In my case I wanted something eye catchy that says quiz and really catches the eyes of the user. 
The background image used is a quiz image found on google with copy rights permission. 

- Look & feel
