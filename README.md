**Purpose**

Hi everyone, I hope you are having a wonderful day today. For this project I have created a nice simple fun quiz for any type of user and the main purpose and goal here is to provide a challenging quiz to entertain online users. There are 10 different questions and the questions are based on random things just as I thought its more fun than just keeping it as the same subject. The purpose of this quiz is to bring fun, joy, and overall, a good quiz experience. As you will notice this quiz has a bright blue colour that really stands out and a background of quiz stars to catch users attention as much as possible. In most cases quiz games are meant to bring excitement and some type of competition to see who got more answers correct or less and therefore I also have introduced a scoreboard which I thought it will bring more excitement to the game. The main purpose of this game is as followed, 

Fun and joyful competition 
Eye catching experience 
Scoreboard to make it more interesting 
Menu navigation bar that allows the user to leave a feed back for a better improvement and also a signup form where the user can always come back as a user and play new quiz games that will be available in near future. 


**Challenges faced:** 

This has been a project full of emotions considering that I am a complete beginner at this. I have spent hours and hours and I am very thankful for the experience. JavaScript was defiantly much tougher than expected but to see the final result was a great joy for me. My biggest challenge was the quiz container itself, the scoreboard, and even the navigation bar. It all took time, to make sure its all functioning the correct way for the user. 

**Quiz container:** 

The quiz container itself has a light blue margin to give catchy attention for the user while playing the quiz. The main fond is “Font-family times new roman”. Nice bold writing so it stands out for the user while reading the question. 

**Background:** 

The background of this quiz is full of positive energy in my opinion as it gives catchy attention thanks to the stars and blue colours mixed with some type of orange. It’s an image already containing the quiz stars. 

**Scoreboard:** 

The scoreboard was one of the most important parts as it keeps the user entertained and focused on the game itself. I wanted this score board to be simple and straight to the point giving the user the score so they can see how many questions they have answered correctly. Also, for you to see how the scoreboard works please do answer the first question as answer "98.6 degrees and press submit. You will notice how the scoreboard shows you 1, which means one question is answered correctly. 

**Menu navigation bar:** 

The menu navigation bar was an important aspect for this project as I thought it’s very important for the user to leave a feedback information so that way I can continue improving. Also, we have a signup page that allows the user to become a user and easily access the page as a user and play new quizzes available in the near future. You might notice that the feedback form and the signup form is not placed in the centre of the page, and to be honest I found it stylish in a way to have it the way it is. I thought both forms are looking eye catchy on the top left side of the page with correct set of margins and padding that makes it look not too big or too small. 

**Submit button:** 

The submit button has the colour of rgb 23, 245, 245, it’s a light blue colour that almost gives the impression of a click me now to see the answer in a positive way. I did not want the user to feel negative during the game and that was the reason for this colour. In many cases users quit as soon as they see red flags everywhere and, in this case, I did not use any red negative flags for this reason. Let’s keep the user happy and entertained in a chilled positive matter. This was my goal for the submit button. 

 **User Goal**

 - Simple to use and keep entertained 
 - Able to see the correct answers 
 - Easy to click and play 
 - Feedback easy to submit 
 - SignUp form easy to complete 




  **Business Goal**

- Giving interest. 
- Engage the viewer.
- Have the viewer coming back to play the game 
- Feedback easy to submit 
- SignUp form easy to complete 


**First Time Visitor Goals**

- As a First Time user, I want them to feel free and happy playing the quiz game.
- As a First Time user, I want them to be able to easily navigate easily throughout the game. 
- As a First Time user, I want them to see their score and keep motivated throughout the game. 
- As a First Time user, I want them to easily to become a user and feel free to join the new quizzes that will be available in the near future. 


**Frequent Visitor Goals**

- As a Frequent user, I would like them to be able to see the new updates and new games available. 

**Structure**

The main structure is based on html and css coding here. Css was the trick to style and have this quiz as eye catchy as possible in order to keep the user entertained and motivated throughout the game. JS came along to make sure it makes the quiz alive, clickable and most importantly having that score board working the correct way. 

**Design**

- Colour  

At first, I wanted to use a normal colour as background but then I came up with this idea of having a background of a quiz image that basically represents everything in one. In my case I wanted something eye catchy that says quiz and really catches the eyes of the user. 
The background image used is a quiz image found on google with copy rights permission.

**Testing**

Testing was very important as we should see if the viewer will be able to comfortably see the website on other devices such as iPads and mobile phones.

I used testing methods by pressing inspect and using dimensions responsive, I have also tried it as iPhone devices etc.

For small screens sizes 800px and down.

**Smaller device such as phones:**

**Testing feature: Quiz container**

Making sure the submit button is clickable, making sure that the scoreboard shows the score and in the end of the game the user can see "try again button". I have tested this out by clicking and playing around with the game making sure is all working. 

**How did I check and the result:**

I played the game several times to see the final result. All worked well. 

**Testing feature: Feedback**

Making sure that the user can type the name and email in the little box with an comment as a feedback and followed by that a submit button that is clickable and easy to click.

**How did I check and the result:**

I filled the form out myself, and everything ran smooth. Submit button is to be clicked. 

**Testing feature: SignUp**

Making sure that the form is big enough, buttons are clickable and that the user can have the option of remember me so they can easily log in the next time. 

**How did I check and the result:**

I filled out the form, clicked all buttons inculding "remember me" all worked perfectly fine. 

**Testing feature: Scoreboard**

The main goal here was to have the scoreboard functioning for the correct answers only. As an example, for you to see how the scoreboard works please do answer the first question as answer "98.6 degrees and press submit. You will notice how the scoreboard shows you 1, which means one question is answered correctly. 

**How did I check and the result:**
